:wave: Hello there!

:boy: My name is Son H. Nguyen. I studied Computer Science (B.Sc., M.Sc., and PhD) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I am now a Postdoc at the Computational Methods Lab at the HafenCity University Hamburg (HCU).

:heart: I am specialized in Large Knowledge Graphs and Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures. I am currently working on Big Geospatial Data using Graphs in conjunction with Machine Learning / Deep Learning methods. The tools developed during my doctorate include [3DCityKG](https://github.com/tum-gis/3dcitykg) - knowledge graphs for cities, and [citymodel-compare](https://github.com/tum-gis/citymodel-compare) - a complete graph-based pipeline for mapping, matching and interpreting changes in massive semantic 3D city models.

:blossom: I am currently the Lead Developer of the [3DCityDB Web Map Client](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-web-map), an open-source tool based on CesiumJS for visualizing 3D city objects, such as those exported from the [3D City Database (3DCityDB)](https://github.com/3dcitydb).
